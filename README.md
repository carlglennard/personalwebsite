Hi! Welcome to my repository! This is a simple website where HTML, CSS, and JS is present. This project can be viewed by simply downloading the repository folder and opening one of the HTML files.

You can navigate by selecting one of the buttons in the nav bar, from there you can navigate your way through the different web pages included. 

If you have any concerns or you want to give me some comments, kindly contact me from the contact information I placed in the webpages. 

Thank you!
